## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\danud\Desktop\New folder (2)"
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open the site**

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Using the app

- **As a citizen**
  - Go to the landing page and click **"I am a citizen / witness"**.
  - Choose your language, read the map-based explanation, then fill in the short form:
    - Select the violation type
    - Provide the location
    - Optionally upload a photo or video
    - Optionally add extra details
  - After submission you will see a **thank-you message**.

- **As an authority member**
  - From the landing page, click **"I am an authority member"**.
  - On the authority page:
    - Either **sign up** (mandatory fields: name, email, password)
    - Or **log in** with an existing account
  - After authentication you are redirected to the **dashboard**:
    - Change sort order using the sort dropdown
    - Update complaint status (open / in progress / resolved)
    - Delete a complaint if it is a **fake allegation**
    - See **office contact details** suggested for each complaint based on its violation type

## Notes

- The reminder mechanism runs in the backend and logs to the console when a complaint is older than 7 days and still not resolved or deleted. In a production system you would connect this to email or notification services.
- The SQLite database file is created automatically in the `server` folder on first run, and some example offices are seeded for common violation types.
